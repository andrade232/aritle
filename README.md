# 3D printing the human heart 
  
   A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University has published a paper in _Science_ that details a new technique allowing anyone to 3D bio-print tissue scaffolds out of collagen, the major structural protein in the human body. This first-of-its-kind method brings the field of tissue engin eering one step closer to being able to 3D print a full-sized, adult human heart.Each of the organs in the human body, such as the heart, is built from specialized cells that are held together by a biological scaffold called the extracellular matrix (ECM).network of ECM proteins provides the structure and biochemical signals that cells need to carry out their normal function. However, until now it has not been possible to rebuild this complex ECM architecture using traditional biofabrication methods."What we've shown is that we can print pieces of the heart out of cells and collagen into parts that truly function, like a heart valve or a small beating ventricle," says Adam Feinberg, a professor of biomedical engineering (BME) and materials science & engineering at Carnegie Mellon,Over 4000 patients in the United States are waiting for a heart transplant, while millions of others worldwide need hearts but are ineligible for the waitlist. The need for replacement organs is immense, and new approaches are needed to engineer artificial organs that are capable of repairing, supplementing, or replacing long-term organ function. Feinberg, who is a member of Carnegie Mellon's _Bioengineered Organs Initiative_, is working to solve these challenges with a new generation of bioengineered organs that more closely replicate natural organ structures.
